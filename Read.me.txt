Fake News Detection using SVM and smoe other models  and TF-IDF

This project aims to detect fake news articles using machine learning techniques. and the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method for text vectorization. The dataset consists of labeled news articles, with real news articles labeled as 0 and fake news articles labeled as 1.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can effectively classify news articles as real or fake. .

Technologies Used:
Python for data processing and modeling.
ML models like RF,LR,NB,SVM
TF-IDF Vectorizer for converting text data into numerical vectors.

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn for additional data processing and evaluation.

Project Steps
Data Preparation:
The project begins by loading the dataset, which contains news articles labeled as 0 (real) or 1 (fake). The dataset is then split into training and testing sets.

Text Preprocessing:
The TF-IDF Vectorizer is applied to the text column to convert the text into numerical representations suitable for model training.

Model Training:
we used ML models like RF,LR,NB,SVM to copare there accuracy and choose the bestfor our case
Model Evaluation:
The models is evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are used to assess the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between real and fake news.


Prediction:
Model                   | Precision (0) | Precision (1) | Recall (0) | Recall (1) | F1-Score (0) | F1-Score (1) | Accuracy | Macro Avg Precision | Macro Avg Recall | Macro Avg F1-Score | Weighted Avg Precision | Weighted Avg Recall | Weighted Avg F1-Score
